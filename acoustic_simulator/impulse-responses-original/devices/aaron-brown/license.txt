These iPhone, iPad and Behritone impulse responses were made by Aaron Brown.

They are free to use and pass on to your friends, but please link them to my website to download them.

They should be useful to any iOS developers or audio people wanting a quick test to see how their mixes sound on mono speakers from these devices.



Enjoy and may the rest of your days be filled with creative inspiration and sonic success :)
