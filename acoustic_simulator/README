 DESCRIPTION
=============

This acoustic simulator allows you to degrade clean audio recordings using a variety of algorithms and data. The simulator offers three main types of degradations:

  - Additive noise from a large collection of open-source real noise recordings of around 60 hours. The noise recordings have been manually assigned one out of the following categories: announcement, bable, crowd, impulsive, music, nature, outdoors, private, public, signaling, sport, transportation. The database must be downloaded from the www.freesound.org website using an API. Check the file README-noise-db.txt for details on how to download the data.

  - Open-source impulse responses sampled from real audio devices, loudspeakers, cabinets and smartphones on one side and rooms on the other side. 74 and 54 impulse responses are provided for devices and rooms respectively. The impulse responses are stored in .wav PCM format and have been manually categorized into directories under impulse-response-original. For the simulator to use these impulse responses they must be normalized and downsampled to 8kHz and 16kHz. Check README-impulse-responses.txt to generate these files as well as download missing files that could not be distributed as part of this package.

  - Speech and audio codecs, a total of 14 codecs for cellular and satellite telephony, voice over IP, and audio recorders. For licensing issues, the code for these codecs is not provided in this package, but download URLs together with code changes and compile instruccions are provided in README-codecs.txt . These should be stored the src directory. The supported codecs are ITU G.711, ITU G.726, ITU G.722, ITU G.728, ITU G.729a, ETSI AMR-NB, ETSI AMR-WB, ETSI GSM-FR, CVSD, Codec2, Skype SILK, Skype SILK-WB, Fraunhofer MP3, Fraunhofer AAC. Telephony band-pass filters G.712, P341, IRS and MIRS can be used in combination with narrow band codecs as well.

  - Noise reduction based on Wiener filtering (Qualcomm-ICSI-OGI) and amplitude normalization is also supported

This package also includes a data set based on the NIST SRE 2010 data (not included) for the evaluation of speaker verification systems. Please read README-file-lists.txt for more information about how to corrupt these audio files so that results are comparable across research labs.

 BUG FIXES
=============

v0.2:

  - Fixed random number generator to choose from all elements in a list

  - Removed medium sized room impulse responses from interview condition. Only small room IR are now used.
